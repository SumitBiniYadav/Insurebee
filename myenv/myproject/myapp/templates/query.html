                        This depends on your selected plan. Basic plans typically have sub-limits such as 1% of sum insured for room rent and 2% for ICU charges. Premium plans may offer no sub-limits ("No Room Rent Capping"). Some plans have procedure-specific limits for certain surgeries. Check your policy document for specific sub-limits applicable to your plan.

                        Third-party insurance only covers damages to other people or their property caused by your vehicle (legally mandatory). Comprehensive insurance covers third-party liabilities PLUS damages to your own vehicle due to accidents, theft, fire, natural disasters, etc. While third-party is cheaper, comprehensive provides complete protection and is highly recommended despite costing 2-3 times more.

It provides protection against accidental damage, theft, fire, explosion, self-ignition, lightning, floods, earthquakes, landslides, rockslides, and other natural calamities. Third-party insurance, however, only covers damages to third parties and doesn't protect your vehicle against these risks.

                        IDV (Insured Declared Value) is the maximum amount payable if your vehicle is stolen or suffers total loss.

Depreciation rates: &lt;6 months: 5%, 6-12 months: 15%, 1-2 years: 20%, 2-3 years: 30%, 3-4 years: 40%, 4-5 years: 50%, &gt;5 years: negotiated value. Higher IDV means higher premium and vice versa.

Even a single claim will reset your NCB to zero. For minor damages, consider paying out of pocket to preserve your NCB. Some premium plans offer "NCB Protect" add-on that allows one claim per year without affecting your NCB.

Roadside assistance covers services like towing, battery jump-start, flat tire change, etc., costing â‚¹500-â‚¹1,500/year. Zero depreciation (or bumper-to-bumper) coverage eliminates depreciation deductions during claims, costing 10-20% extra premium, but is highly recommended for new vehicles up to 5 years old.
